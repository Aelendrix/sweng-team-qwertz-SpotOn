# Team Qwertz: SpotOn

The basic concept of this app is ephemeral geolocalized photo and video sharing. A media can be viewed only in a certain radius around the original posting spot, and will be deleted after a certain duration.
Viewers can also rate photos, which has 2 consequences :   
* popular medias remain alive longer and/or have a wider radius  
* user profiles have a “karma” indicator, based on the popularity of their posts

Lastly, most popular nearby posts would be displayed on a map in-app.
