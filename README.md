# Team Qwertz: SpotOn

The basic concept of this app is ephemeral geolocalized photo and video sharing. A media can be viewed only in a certain radius around the original posting spot, and will be deleted after a certain duration.
Viewers can also rate photos, which has 2 consequences :   
* popular medias remain alive longer and/or have a wider radius  
* user profiles have a “karma” indicator, based on the popularity of their posts

Lastly, most popular nearby posts would be displayed on a map in-app.


## Product backlog:

* Take a picture/video from the smartphone and get its location via GPS
* Display medias according to user’s location
* User authentication
* Life time attached to pictures (12, 24 hours…)
* “Karma” system for users
* Find media’s location from user’s interface
* Rating system linked to media’s lifespan
* Display map with pins (correspond to locations where some pictures have been taken)
* Itinerary feature to hotspot
* Retrieve photo from server depending of pos
* Add friends in-app
* share photos with friends
* post photos on facebook


## Sprint #1 Backlog:

* Research how to access smartphone’s camera to store photos and videos + micro-tests - 3 hours
* Research how to access smartphone’s GPS and how to use it - 3 hours
* Research how to implement server access which we’ll use for the app - 6 hours
* Start designing and implementing GUI - 6 hours
